  <h1><b>What is this?</b></h1>
  <p>
    Alright, so heres just a bunch of math programs that I made in grade 10, compiled into one huge(?) program. Initially my goal was to just make a program to qualify for the IT Exhibition that our school was holding, but I sort of got dragged into this rabbit hole of learning about math and I learnt a lot of new stuff in this process. There's a lot of documentation(thanks to my friend for telling me to do this) in the code itself so I hope it'll be easy to understand.
